    <h1>Homework 7: Census Data Choropleth</h1>
    
    <h2>Kate Milner</h2>
    <p>This is a map of the number of households with grandchildren in Massachusetts in the projection of NAD83 Massachusetts Mainland in US feet ESPG 2249. I found the data for this map on the Census website under the category of Families and Living Arrangements. I used the dataset called Household Type by Relationship and deleted all of the other categories besides Households with Grandchildren. Under the structure of the nuclear family, we don't think about grandchildren and grandparents living in the same households, but this is very normal in other family structures. Because of this, I thought it would be interesting to see geographically what areas have a larger number of households with grandchildren.</p>
