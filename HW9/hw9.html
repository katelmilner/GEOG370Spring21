    <h1>Homework 9: Breadwinner Mothers Choropleth</h1>
    
    <h2>Kate Milner</h2>
    <p>This is a map of the number of households with a mother as the breadwinner as a percent of all households per state in the United States in 2013. The map is projected in EPSG 102004 Lambert Conformal Conic. I used equal intervals to classify the data because I think they best displayed the spread of the data. While most of the data does fall into two classes, this is reflective of the spread of the data. Mississippi and DC have the highest percentages of breadwinning mothers while Utah has the lowest, and, for the most part, all of the other states are in the middle. I thought this was interesting because I was surprised that in the majority of states mothers are the breadwinners in about 50 percent of the households. I thought this might reflect an increasing trend towards gender pay equity, but I think it might more accurately reflect the number of households that are headed by mothers.</p>
